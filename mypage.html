    <h1>Hardy, Matthew</h1>
    <p>
        I grew up a dual citizen between the United States and Canada even though I was born and raised in Plano, TX.
        I was baptized in a small church on the island of Montreal, Canada and my middle name is Chevalier, which is french for knight.
        I am a huge fan of hockey and was a season ticket holder for the Dallas Stars my senior year of high school.
        I am studying computer science because I have always enjoyed problem solving and creating projects, which computer science lets me do with little to no restrictions on what I can create. The ability to make almost any software limited only by time and your imagination is my favorite part about software
